## Lesson 2 Notes:

- TS: Strongly Typed (Specify Your Data Types) & Statically Typed (Types Checked at Compile Time).

- JS: Weakly Typed (Does Not Require Type Specification) & Dynamically Typed (Types Checked at Run Time).

- TS Advantages: Self Documenting Code, Catch Errors in Dev, Great for Teams
